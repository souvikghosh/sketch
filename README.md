This is a browser version of Etch A Sketch. User is first given a choice as to how many square grid does he/she want. Depending on the input there is a grid of squares presented to the user. When the user hovers the mouse over grids the trail is visible as the squares display different colors.
There are 4 versions of sketches supported:
1- color: this version randomly allocates colors to the squares.
2- black: only has black colored squares
3- grey: only has grey colored squares
4- trailer: leaves a small trail with a black square followed by a few grey squares which fall back to its original state after the mouse moves away.
